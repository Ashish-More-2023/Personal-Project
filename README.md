# DevOps Practice Project 🚀

This is a **dummy React project** created with the primary goal of gaining hands-on experience with **DevOps practices and tools**.  
The application itself is not intended for production — it serves as a sandbox environment to **learn, test, and implement** various DevOps workflows and tools in a real-world setup.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

The main purpose of this project is to **develop expertise in modern DevOps workflows** by practicing with the following tools and technologies:

### 🔹 Core Topics
- **Docker** – Containerization of the application  
- **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration and scaling  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Continuous integration and deployment setup  
- **Monitoring & Logging** – Integration with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack  
- **Version Control & Branching Strategy** – Git-based workflow and automation  
- **Cloud Deployment** – Optionally test deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite or CRA)
- **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript
- **DevOps Tools:**  
  - Docker & Docker Compose  
  - Kubernetes (Minikube / K3s / GKE)  
  - Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI  
  - Helm, ArgoCD, or other orchestration tools (optional)

## 🏗️ Learning Roadmap

1. **Setup React Project**
   - Create and run a local development environment  
   - Build the app and create production-ready files

2. **Containerization**
   - Write a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`  
   - Build and run the app inside a container

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Configure automated build, test, and deployment  
   - Integrate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins

4. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress)  
   - Test deployment on Minikube or a cloud cluster

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up basic observability using Prometheus and Grafana

6. **Experimentation & Documentation**
   - Document all findings, issues, and learnings during the process
